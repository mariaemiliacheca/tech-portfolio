I am a Computer Science student with a passion for technology and problem-solving. I am eager to learn and curious about how computer science can impact different parts of our lives. More specifically, I am interested in Mobile & App Development, User Experience, and Web Design. I aspire to impulse the involvement of Latinos and Hispanics in STEM, by providing a supportive community with a focus on professional and personal development.
