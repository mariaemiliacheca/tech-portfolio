# CoFounder & President - Dalhousie Latinos and Hispanics in STEM Society

I have made it my goal to create a society where we aim to impulse the involvement of Latinos and Hispanics in STEM fields. Our society is aiming to achieve this by creating a safe space for members to connect and rely on for professional and personal development.
